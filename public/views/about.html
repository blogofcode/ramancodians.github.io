                    I’m Raman Choudhary, a young 21 year old frontend developer graduating from my undergrad in April 2016.
              <br><br>
                                            After learning <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span>, <span>JS</span> and basic <span>php</span> in my high school, I discovered my passion is “<span>Creating solutions with technology</span>”. During this time a worked for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam" target="_blank" >Dr. APJ Abdul Kamal</a>’s NGO <a href="http://www.outlookindia.com/article/what-can-i-give-to-my-nation/233711" target="_blank">What I Can Give</a>. I left my city (Jaipur) in 2013 for a 3 year Computer Science Course in <a href="http://christuniversity.in" target="_blank">Christ University</a>, Bangalore. In my 2nd semester, I created a web-app that helped me to connect with like-minded people in class and together we formed a group called <a href="http://codians.com" target="_blank">Codians</a>. I took some time to understand the making apps is more than writing codes. It’s about <span>solving problems</span>. In my final year of college I’m exploring the concepts of <span>UI</span>, <span>Usability</span>, <span>Branding</span> and <span>Community-building</span> and my favorite <span>UX</span>.

                    <p class="para">
                      Truth is, I’m always been an average student. <span>Science</span> and <span>Arts</span> were my favorite subjects during high  school and I had hard time deciding what I want to do after school. In college, I worked more on my <span>interpersonal skills</span>. Here I realized I work better <span>in a Team.</span> <br><br>

<span>Curiosity </span> has been my biggest teacher. I explore the internet to learn <span>techniques</span> and <span>best practices</span>, and according to me formal education just slowed this process of self-learning. I spend 80% of my time learning things that interest me. Be it new tools, new languages, frameworks, vanilla code or design practices. The remaining in implementation and take feedback from real users. <span>Sleepless nights</span> for pushing an update, that’s what I live for.

                    <p class="para">
                    In college, a few of my classmates and me <span>founded a startup</span> called <a href="http://codians.com" target="_blank">Codians Inc</a>.  It was a Web Designing & Development Agency. I co-founded Codians with <span>Fabian Enos</span>, <span>Karan Bhavnani</span> , <span>Aayush Jhunjhunwala</span> and <span>Prajjwal Gupta</span>. Fabian managed the backend and I designed and coded the frontend.  We <span>developed websites</span> for various <span>fests</span>, <span>Android App</span> for CSA (Centre for Social Activities, Christ University) and an <span> Android Game</span> - <a href="http://codians.com/howhigh" target="_blank">HowHigh</a>. It helped us earn some extra pocket money.  But our <span>favorite</span> part was developing our own apps. Projects like StudyAlley, ChristCode, Connecto, HowHigh, Bunky and many more were developed under Codians. It also gave me the opportunity to work with some <span>amazing people</span>. They were my true teachers in college and motivated me to explore more. Codians taught me a lot about the Indian startup scenario and  its entrepreneurial ecosystem.

                    I believe that <span>internet will change everything</span>. I already see that happening but in future embed it even deeper in our life. Internet is <span>empowering everything we do</span>, therefore it’s becoming more complex. Users have more options and less patience for the content. For me it is fascinating how all this fits together. And I feel proud every time I open favorite text editor (Adobe Brackets) and see “<span>Code the Web</span>”.
